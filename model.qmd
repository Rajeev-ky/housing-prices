We have created a linear regression model where estimated price is the outcome of prefarea and furnishing status of the housing. The mathematical model is 

$$housing\_price = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} prefareayes_i - 
\beta_{2}furnishingstatussemiMfurnished_i - \beta_{3}furnishingstatusfurnished_i + \epsilon_{i}$$

Below table summaries the regression coefficients of the model

housing <- read_csv("data/housing.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

housing_ppf <- housing |> select(price, prefarea, furnishingstatus)

fit1 <- brm(formula = price ~ prefarea + furnishingstatus,
            data = housing_ppf,
            family = gaussian(),
            refresh = 0,
            silent = 2,
            seed = 9
            )

tbl_regression(fit1)
